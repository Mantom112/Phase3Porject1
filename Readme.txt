Tommy Nelson
Kyle Wieser

To run the python script run a cmd prompt, then go into the folder that has both the script and the python file and type "python TommyKylePhase3.py"
this will run the script, first it will ask you to input the name of the database you want to connect to, be sure to have the .db at the end eg. Nelson_Wieser.db
If you used Nelson_Wieser.db it should run through the queries that we have coded in. If you do not use Nelson_Wieser.db the system will instead ask you to input your own queries
it will do this 5 times. If it did not connect to a db the system will throw an error when it tries to get user input for query. After either of these are completed the script will end.
